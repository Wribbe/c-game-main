  * Can't jump when landed on the floor.
    - velocity is set to the invers of itself * length of the normal (1.0f)
    - Does not budge even when resulting velocity is positive along y-axis.
    - Where does it collide?
    - Collides the first thing it does.
    - The floor appears to collide with the box due to coordinates not being
      updated when the floor is set at lower coordinates.....
